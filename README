Removing old sqlite database: rm -r ~/Library/Application\ Support/iPhone\ Simulator/*/Applications/*/Documents/Munin.sqlite

Using categories from a library with iPhone: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa2006/qa1490.html

 => I don't know why, but the configurations of all subprojects should be the same as the Munin project.
 E.g.: Device/Simulator v.s. Arm6/Arm7
